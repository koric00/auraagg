# AuraAgg - Advanced Cross-Chain Aggregation Router

A high-performance, cross-chain DEX aggregator with MEV protection and optimized routing.

## Architecture Overview

AuraAgg consists of several key components:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Multi-chain node cluster (EVM & Solana)
   - Chain data indexing with TheGraph, Chainbase, and custom Rust parsers
   - Real-time event streaming with Redis

2. **Router Engine Core**
   - Optimized path-finding algorithms (Python/Cython)
   - MEV protection mechanisms
   - Asynchronous transaction execution (Rust)

3. **Smart Contract Architecture**
   - Diamond standard router contracts
   - Gas-optimized libraries
   - Cross-chain atomic swap protocols

4. **Key Dependencies**
   - Price oracles: Pyth Network + Chainlink
   - Transaction simulation: Tenderly Fork API
   - Cross-chain verification: zkBridge
   - Frontend SDK: Web3Modal v3 + Wagmi
